# seQura backend coding challenge
Ruby on Rails application that automates a calculation of merchantsâ€™ disbursements payouts and seQura commissions.
Link to original challenge: https://sequra.github.io/backend-challenge/

Application uses:
 - Ruby version - 3.0.4
 - Rails version - 7.1.2
 - PostgreSQL version - 14.10
 - Sidekiq version - 7.2

## Features
  1. Parsing `merchants.csv` file to validate and save data in `merchants` table
  2. Parsing `orders.csv` file to validate, calculate fee and save data in `orders` table
  3. Calculate monthly fees for all existing merchants from `live on` date to current date
  4. Calculate daily and weekly disbursements for all merchants' orders
  5. Calculate disbursements on daily basis
  6. Calculate disbursements on weekly basis

## Features to do
  Due to the time constraints I was not able to finish:
  1. Dynamic monthly fee calculation at the beginning of each month and tests for this feature.
      - **possible solution**: create cron job that executes on the background via Sidekiq at the first day of each month (at night), checks all orders created within the last month, calculates total generated fee for each merchant and fee to be charged and saves all needed information in `monthly_fees` table. Provide tests for this feature.
  2. Some code refinements for better maintainability.

## Calculations
**Note:** Monthly fee calculations for all merchants are calculated from `live on` date to current date (last calculated month is December 2023), even if there are no orders for December in `orders.csv` file!

Year	| Number of disbursements | Amount disbursed to merchants | Amount of order fees | Number of monthly fees charged (From minimum monthly fee) | Amount of monthly fee charged (From minimum monthly fee) |
------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
2022  | 1009                    | 29035379.3                    | 262968.56            | 46                                                        | 1072.88                                            |
2023  | 7870                    | 143096726.46                  | 1300058.84           | 214                                                       | 4868.69                                            |



## Files to download (DB dump, .CSV files)
Dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/r3x8xnbbmbqnm6s2mujaa/h?rlkey=2x62x65vkbxy2aru05ui4c8iu&dl=0

.CSV files provided via the original challenge are invalid.

## Launch
Before start working with the database, ensure you have the PostgreSQL service running: `brew services list`

1. `git clone git@github.com:denis-mironov/sequra.git`
2. `bundle install`
3. `rake db:create`
4. Filling DB with data:
    - Parsing .CSV files and using rake tasks (***time consuming operation***):
      - `rake db:migrate`
      - `download 'merchants.csv' and 'orders.csv' files via Dropbox link above`
      - `create new 'db/csv_dumps' directory in the project and put downloaded .CSV files there`
      - run next rake tasks:
      - `rake fill_table_with_data:merchants`
      - `rake fill_table_with_data:orders`
      - `rake fill_table_with_data:monthly_fees`
      - `rake disbursements:fill_daily`
      - `rake disbursements:fill_weekly`

    - Using DB dump (merchants, orders, disbursements and monthly_fees are included):
      - `download 'development_dump.sql' file via Dropbox link above`
      - `psql sequra_development < link_to_downloaded_dump_file`
      - `rake db:migrate`

## Check Sidekiq jobs execution
  1. Install and run Redis service ([official Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/install/install-redis/install-redis-on-mac-os/))
  2. Run Sidekiq server with `sidekiq` comand.
## Run test files
 - `rspec spec`
## Run rubocop checks
 - `rubocop`
## Problems during development process
  1. .CSV files provided via the original challenge are invalid. They have correct file extension, but internal structure is invalid. before starting the challenge I converted them to correct .CSV format.
  2. Some `amount` fields in `orders.csv` file are incorrect. I applied data converters and strict validations on models to avoid saving invalid data.
